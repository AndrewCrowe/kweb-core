# API validation

`kweb-core.api` is generated by the [binary compatibility validator](https://github.com/Kotlin/binary-compatibility-validator)
plugin.  It is used to ensure that the public API of `kweb-core` is stable.

## How to update the API

If this check has a false-positive, or you really want to make a change to the public API of `kweb-core` you will 
need to regenerate the kweb-core.api file:

```bash
$ ./gradlew :kweb-core:apiDump
```
